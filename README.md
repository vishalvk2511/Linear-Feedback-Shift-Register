Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) Implementation in C
This repository contains an implementation of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) in the C programming language. The LFSR is designed using the recurrence relation:

S[i+4] = S[i] + S[i+1]

This approach generates a sequence of bits that can be used in cryptography, pseudo-random number generation, and error detection.

Features:
Recurrence-based bit sequence generation
Efficient C implementation
Modular code for easy understanding and extension
Getting Started:
Clone the repository and compile the code to see the LFSR in action. Modify the initial seed to generate different sequences.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
